Welcome to the first hotfix release of 2021 - let us hope it will be the last one. This release fixes receiving some YouTube content, an app crash and brings you a new translation.

<!-- more -->

## Changes

A short release, so this blog post is short as well. These are the fixes which found their way into this release:

* [YouTube] getting related videos from channels ([@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R)) and playlists [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin)
* [YouTube] getting comments [@golfinq](https://github.com/golfinq)
* [SoundCloud] getting geo restricted content as well as the client id [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr)
* [App] crash when reordering channel groups [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne)

Next to these fixes, two new features are part of this app now. NewPipe now correctly resolves custom subpaths from YouTube like <code>/watch</code> or <code>/w/</code>. Northern Kudish speakers can enjoy NewPipe in their language.

## Where to get this brand-new version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions. You can download them when you press the notification, which will take you to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases).

If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it, too, notifies you about updates for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/).

!!! Please be aware that F-Droid is currently unable to publish a new version of NewPipe (the latest version available is 0.20.1, in which YouTube is already broken) due to an issue that applies only to reproducible apps. Hence it is our recommendation that you install NewPipe:

- from our custom NewPipe F-Droid repo by following the [FAQ entry]({{ site.baseurl }}/FAQ/tutorials/install-add-fdroid-repo/), or
- from GitHub Releases.

Make sure you back up your data as mentioned in the warning at the top of the FAQ page!

Note: If you installed NewPipe from GitHub Releases you will not have to uninstall NewPipe to switch to our custom repo. Just let it update your current version.

Now that you've (hopefully) updated, please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or, ideally, use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports. You can even [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.

If you have any other questions feel free to post them in the comments here and someone will reply to you.

You want another update? We have another update. Welcome to version 0.21.3, where nothing extraordinarily exciting happened. But hey, you can move NewPipe to your SD card now, and you get some quality of life changes as well as bug fixes, which is also nice, isn't it? So take a relaxing cup of tea and read through this blog post about relaxing changes. Relax. Deep breaths. Hot tea. And let's guide you through the changes.

<!-- more -->

## New

- [@fynngodau](https://github.com/fynngodau) added the first page of Bandcamp comments. This means a maximum of 3 comments will be shown per song. No further comments.

- [@mhmdanas](https://github.com/mhmdanas) enabled NewPipe to be installed on external storage. Those with SD cards, please test it out and tell us if everything works fine!


## Improved

- The backup and import location of NewPipe are now persistent. This means when you do one of those two actions and then do the other (or the same one again), the file chooser will show you the last folder you picked. Thank you [@ATofighi](https://github.com/ATofighi) for implementing this.

- another workaround for HLS streams for PeerTube got added by [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr). They work again now and will work even better once they are probably implemented in the player. Watching videos from PeerTube instances like [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) is working again.

- [@mhmdanas](https://github.com/mhmdanas) removed several unnecessary newlines from the files containing translations for the app. Begone, newlines! You are not welcome in these hallowed pipes.


### Fixed

- [@subraizada3](https://github.com/subraizada3) fixed a bug where the download toast would be shown a second time if you tried to download the exact same thing twice, even though instead of starting a duplicate download, NewPipe shows a confirmation dialog asking if you want to generate a unique name or cancel the second download. A confirmation dialog is clearly not the same thing as a download, and now the app knows that as well.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) noticed that the app was sending a reCAPTCHA cookie with every request, instead only when it needed to. The empty reCHAPTCHA cookies might have caused problems for a few people. This is fixed now.

- While investigating a playback performance issue, [@Redirion](https://github.com/Redirion) discovered that the player was using a cache size that was below the minimum value recommended by ExoPlayer. This could have been causing performance issues for some users, but it is fixed now. If you were one of those affected, please test this release and see if playback is smooth again for you.

- [@ix5](https://github.com/ix5) fixed a bug where deleting several downloads from within Newpipe one after the other would create multiple undo snackbars, which keep piling up, taking a long while to dismiss on their own. Newer snackbars now correctly replace previous ones, so only the last snackbar is left to dismiss.

- There was a regression in the last version: the video always paused immediately upon starting after tapping the thumbnail, and every video consequently needed an extra tap to play. This was the case even if autoplay was enabled. Now it doesn't pause needlessly again, all thanks to [@litetext](https://github.com/litetex).

- Also in the last version, we updated the ExoPlayer library, which handles playing all media in NewPipe. Sadly, with this update, ExoPlayer tried to be smarter about what decoder to choose on the device, and that resulted in some people getting stuttering videos, since it choose the wrong decoder. So we (read: [@Redirion](https://github.com/Redirion)) downgraded the library (deja vu in reverse!?), and will keep track of development to see if we can upgrade it again later.

- [@sauravrao637](https://github.com/sauravrao637) fixed a crash when trying to delete an object from a list when that object isn't actually there in said list.

- now you can go back from the report error page when pressing back. Previously the button was there but it didn't do anything. Credits for that change go to [@ATofighi](https://github.com/ATofighi).


## Nerd Talk

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) fixed a failing YouTube test.

- [@sauravrao637](https://github.com/sauravrao637) replaced an if-else block with a switch statement in the error activity code, and also suppressed a false warning in Android Studio for that statement.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) added an extension function to simplify some code.

- [@mhmdanas](https://github.com/mhmdanas) tweaked unrelated code snippets here and there to fix a bunch of warnings.

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) updated actions/setup-java for Github Actions to v2.

- Do you remember that [@Redirion](https://github.com/Redirion) did something close to black magic with media tunneling in the last release? Well, he did it again. Now everyone using a debug app can switch media tunneling off. That makes it much easier figuring out if a bug is related to this or not.

- [@mhmdanas](https://github.com/mhmdanas) made three small changes to the code, which didn't change functionality, just made it look cleaner.


## Where to get this brand-new version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions. You can download them when you press the notification, which will take you to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases).

If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it, too, notifies you about updates for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/).
Please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository. If you have problems installing you may need to uninstall NewPipe and then install it afresh. (Make sure to backup data by exporting your database from the Content settings menu.)

If you already installed NewPipe from F-Droid’s repository, to get this version of NewPipe you can do one of the following:

* Wait for them to update
* Switch to NewPipe’s custom repository by following the [directions in the announcement post](https://newpipe.net/blog/announcement/f-droid/pinned/f-droid-repo/)

Note: If you installed NewPipe from GitHub Releases you will not have to uninstall NewPipe to switch to our custom repo. Just let it update your current version.
Make sure you back up your data as mentioned in the warning at the top of the FAQ page!

Now that you've (hopefully) updated, please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or, ideally, use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports. You can even [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.

If you have any other questions, feel free to post them in the comments here and someone will reply to you.
